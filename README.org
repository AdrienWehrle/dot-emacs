* Emacs configuration

My everyday workflow is based on my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] configuration. Appearance
follows [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][spacemacs]] ([[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme#:~:text=Spacemacs%20theme%20is%20an%20Emacs,well%20with%20256%20color%20terminals.][spacemacs-theme]] and [[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline][spaceline]]). I use it to
code/write (mainly in Python, C++, bash, SWIG, tex, org) but also for
agenda planning and task management, version control, remote access,
terminal emulation, and more applications that I find useful. And
probably more in the future.  Keep improving fast movement and
efficient key bindings is part of the process, too.

** Setup
If you want to try this configuration:

First, clone the repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
git clone git@github.com:AdrienWehrle/dot-emacs.git
#+END_SRC

Backup your old =~/.emacs.d= and =~/.emacs=-file (if necessary).
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d-bak
mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs-bak
#+END_SRC

And finally, make this configuration operational.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
mv dot-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
